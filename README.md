# OneSignal REST API Wrapper For Laravel/Lumen

## Introduction

This project is a Laravel 6+ / Lumen wrapper for the OneSignal REST API v1.
It supports all operations currently supported by the API.

## Installation (Laravel and Lumen)

Require the package with composer.

```sh
composer require dreamonkey/laravel-onesignal-rest-api
```

## Laravel Users:

Service provider will be auto-discovered.

## Lumen Users:

Update `bootstrap/app.php`, adding the following entry

```php
$app->register( \Dreamonkey\OneSignal\OneSignalServiceProvider::class );
class_alias( 'Dreamonkey\OneSignal\OneSignalFacade', 'OneSignal' );
```

## Configuration

There are three values that need to be set in order to use the library: your default OneSignal app ID, the REST API key and your account User Auth Key.
All of these items can be found in your Control Panel on the OneSignal site.
First two are app-related and can be found inside your app settings in the "Keys & IDs" tab (upper left corner), the third is account-related and can be found pressing your account avatar (lower right corner) and selecting "Account & API Keys".

Place the 3 keys into your .env file, as such:

```
ONESIGNAL_APP_ID=
ONESIGNAL_REST_API_KEY=
ONESIGNAL_USER_AUTH_KEY=
```

## Usage

There is a function for each of the OneSignal API calls. They are broken down here.
All methods will return an array formatted like this:

```
    [
        'status' => < HTTP status code of the request >,
        'data' => [
            < data returned by OneSignal REST API in array format >
        ],
    ]
```

**Note:** In all instances where an \$app_id is asked for, omitting it will grab the default OneSignal App ID specified in the .env file
